excerpt: "Alembic is a starting point for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) projects. Rather than starting from scratch, this boilerplate is designed to get the ball rolling immediately. Install it, configure it, tweak it, push it."

Greetings! I am a first-year PhD student studying computer science at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu){:target="_blank"}, currently working with professor [Fabián E. Bustamante](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~fabianb/){:target="_blank"} and wonderful labmates in [AquaLab](https://aqualab.cs.northwestern.edu){:target="_blank"}.

I received my masters degree in Communication Engineering advised by professor [Polly Huang](https://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~pollyhuang/){:target="_blank"} and my bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering, both at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/){:target="_blank"}. Prior to Northwestern, I also worked breifly at Microsoft, Taiwan as a customer engineer. 

My research focuses on computer networks, particularly Internet measurements and content distribution networks. Recently I'm working on characterizing and analyzing the centralization of Internet resources.
